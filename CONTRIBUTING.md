## How to Contribute

There are three primary ways you can contribute. It is up to you to contribute at your own level, which means that you are responsible for your own onboarding. We will not hold your hand. As such, this repo is the single source of truth. 

### Discussions

Head on over to the discussions tab to share ideas, ask questions, provide resources, and so on. This is the lowest barrier of entry, as you can just use this web interface. Your contribution may or may not be integrated into the manuscript.

### Issues

If there's a specific concern that you can cite, you may also create an issue. Keep in mind that this must be both specific and actionable. Low effort issues will be deleted. 

### Pull Requests

You may submit a PR. Your PR must include specific notes as to what you're changing or why. All PRs without good notes will be deleted. 

## Ethos

Please see `C3P0.txt` for the full code of ethics. The TLDR is:

1. Don't waste time
2. Do no harm
3. Add value
